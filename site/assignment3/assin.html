are desirable. While the quest for a way to create efficient, portable (platform-independent)
programs is nearly as old as the discipline of programming itself, it had taken a back seat to
other, more pressing problems. Further, because (at that time) much of the computer world
had divided itself into the three competing camps of Intel, Macintosh, and UNIX, most
programmers stayed within their fortified boundaries, and the urgent need for portable
code was reduced. However, with the advent of the Internet and the Web, the old problem
of portability returned with a vengeance. After all, the Internet consists of a diverse,
distributed universe populated with various types of computers, operating systems, and
CPUs. Even though many kinds of platforms are attached to the Internet, users would like
them all to be able to run the same program. What was once an irritating but low-priority
problem had become a high-profile necessity.
By 1993, it became obvious to members of the Java design team that the problems of
portability frequently encountered when creating code for embedded controllers are also
found when attempting to create code for the Internet. In fact, the same problem that Java
was initially designed to solve on a small scale could also be applied to the Internet on a
large scale. This realization caused the focus of Java to switch from consumer electronics
to Internet programming. So, while the desire for an architecture-neutral programming
language provided the initial spark, the Internet ultimately led to Java’s large-scale success.
As mentioned earlier, Java derives much of its character from C and C++. This is by
intent. The Java designers knew that using the familiar syntax of C and echoing the
object-oriented features of C++ would make their language appealing to the legions of
experienced C/C++ programmers. In addition to the surface similarities, Java shares some
of the other attributes that helped make C and C++ successful. First, Java was designed,
tested, and refined by real, working programmers. It is a language grounded in the needs
and experiences of the people who devised it. Thus, Java is a programmer’s language.
Second, Java is cohesive and logically consistent. Third, except for those constraints
imposed by the Internet environment, Java gives you, the programmer, full control. If you
program well, your programs reflect it. If you program poorly, your programs reflect that,
too. Put differently, Java is not a language with training wheels. It is a language for
professional programmers.this complex encapsulation: by moving the gear-shift lever. You can’t affect the transmission
by using the turn signal or windshield wipers, for example. Thus, the gear-shift lever is a
well-defined (indeed, unique) interface to the transmission. Further, what occurs inside the
transmission does not affect objects outside the transmission. For example, shifting gears
does not turn on the headlights! Because an automatic transmission is encapsulated, dozens
of car manufacturers can implement one in any way they please. However, from the driver’s
point of view, they all work the same. This same idea can be applied to programming.
The power of encapsulated code is that everyone knows how to access it and thus can use
it regardless of the implementation details—and without fear of unexpected side effects.</p>

<P>In Java, the basis of encapsulation is the class. Although the class will be examined in great
detail later in this book, the following brief discussion will be helpful now. A class defines
the structure and behavior (data and code) that will be shared by a set of objects. Each object
of a given class contains the structure and behavior defined by the class, as if it were stamped
out by a mold in the shape of the class. For this reason, objects are sometimes referred to as
instances of a class. Thus, a class is a logical construct; an object has physical reality.
When you create a class, you will specify the code and data that constitute that class.
Collectively, these elements are called members of the class. Specifically, the data defined by
the class are referred to as member variables or instance variables. The code that operates on
that data is referred to as member methods or just methods. (If you are familiar with C/C++, it
may help to know that what a Java programmer calls a method, a C/C++ programmer calls a
function.) In properly written Java programs, the methods define how the member variables
can be used. This means that the behavior and interface of a class are defined by the methods
that operate on its instance data.
Since the purpose of a class is to encapsulate complexity, there are mechanisms for
hiding the complexity of the implementation inside the class. Each method or variable in a
class may be marked private or public. The public interface of a class represents everything
that external users of the class need to know, or may know. The private methods and data
can only be accessed by code that is a member of the class. Therefore, any other code that
is not a member of the class cannot access a private method or variable. Since the private
